# ðŸš€ Learning GitHub Actions as a Frontend Developer

Welcome! This repository documents my learning journey into **GitHub Actions**, with a focus on how it can be used in frontend development workflows. Whether you're a beginner or just curious about automating your projects, I hope this helps you get started!

## ðŸ“š What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a powerful CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool built into GitHub. It allows you to automate tasks like:

- Running tests
- Building your app
- Linting code
- Deploying to servers or static hosting
- Sending notifications (Slack, Discord, etc.)

All from within your GitHub repository using simple `.yml` configuration files.

## ðŸ§  Why I Started Using It

As a frontend developer, I wanted to:

- **Automatically run ESLint and Prettier** on every PR
- **Build and deploy my app** to Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages
- **Run tests** (like Jest or Cypress) automatically
- Learn more about CI/CD best practices
